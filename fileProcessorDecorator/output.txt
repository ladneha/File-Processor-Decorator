It took another week for them to reach Devagiri.
The capital city of the Meluhans stood on the west bank of the Saraswati, which emerged at the confluence of the Sudej and Yamuna rivers. Sadly, the Saraswati’s flow was severely reduced compared to her once mighty size. But even in her abbreviated state, she was still massive and awe-inspiring. Unlike many of the tempestuous rivers of the Punjab, the Saraswati was achingly calm. The river seemed to sense that her days were coming to an end. Yet, she did not fight aggressively to thrust her way through and survive. Instead, she unselfishly gave her all to those who came to seek her treasures.
The soaring Devagiri though, was in complete contrast to the mellow Saraswati. Like all Meluhan cities, Devagiri too was built on giant platforms, an effective protection against floods and a sturdy defence against enemies. However, where Devagiri was different from other Meluhan cities was in its sheer size. The city sprawled over three giant platforms, each of them spreading over three hundred and fifty hectares, significantly larger than other cities. The platforms were nearly eight metres high and were bastioned with giant blocks of cut stone interspaced with baked bricks. Two of the platforms, named Tamra and Rajat, literally, bronze and silver, were for the common man, whereas the platform named Svarna or gold was the royal citadel. The platforms were connected to each other by tall bridges, made of stones and baked bricks, which rose above the flood plains below.
Along the periphery of each enormous platform were towering city walls, with giant spikes facing outwards. There were turrets at regular intervals along the city walls from where approaching enemies could be repelled. This spectacle was beyond anything that Shiva had ever seen. In his mind, the construction of a city like this must truly be man’s greatest achievement.
Shiva’s entourage rode up to the drawbridge across the field of spikes to the Tamra platform. The drawbridge had been reinforced with metal bars at the bottom and had roughened baked bricks laid out on top so that horses and chariots would not slip. There was something about the bricks he had seen across the empire that had intrigued Shiva. Turning to Nandi he asked, Are these bricks made as per some standard process?’.
‘Yes my Lord,’ replied a surprised Nandi. All the bricks in Meluha are made as per specifications and guidelines given by the Chief Architect of the empire. But how did you guess?’

It
took
another
week
for
them
to
reach
Devagiri.

The
capital
city
of
the
Meluhans
stood
on
the
west
bank
of
the
Saraswati,
which
emerged
at
the
confluence
of
the
Sudej
and
Yamuna
rivers.
Sadly,
the
Saraswati’s
flow
was
severely
reduced
compared
to
her
once
mighty
size.
But
even
in
her
abbreviated
state,
she
was
still
massive
and
awe-inspiring.
Unlike
many
of
the
tempestuous
rivers
of
the
Punjab,
the
Saraswati
was
achingly
calm.
The
river
seemed
to
sense
that
her
days
were
coming
to
an
end.
Yet,
she
did
not
fight
aggressively
to
thrust
her
way
through
and
survive.
Instead,
she
unselfishly
gave
her
all
to
those
who
came
to
seek
her
treasures.
The
soaring
Devagiri
though,
was
in
complete
contrast
to
the
mellow
Saraswati.
Like
all
Meluhan
cities,
Devagiri
too
was
built
on
giant
platforms,
an
effective
protection
against
floods
and
a
sturdy
defence
against
enemies.
However,
where
Devagiri
was
different
from
other
Meluhan
cities
was
in
its
sheer
size.
The
city
sprawled
over
three
giant
platforms,
each
of
them
spreading
over
three
hundred
and
fifty
hectares,
significantly
larger
than
other
cities.
The
platforms
were
nearly
eight
metres
high
and
were
bastioned
with
giant
blocks
of
cut
stone
interspaced
with
baked
bricks.
Two
of
the
platforms,
named
Tamra
and
Rajat,
literally,
bronze
and
silver,
were
for
the
common
man,
whereas
the
platform
named
Svarna
or
gold
was
the
royal
citadel.
The
platforms
were
connected
to
each
other
by
tall
bridges,
made
of
stones
and
baked
bricks,
which
rose
above
the
flood
plains
below.
Along
the
periphery
of
each
enormous
platform
were
towering
city
walls,
with
giant
spikes
facing
outwards.
There
were
turrets
at
regular
intervals
along
the
city
walls
from
where
approaching
enemies
could
be
repelled.
This
spectacle
was
beyond
anything
that
Shiva
had
ever
seen.
In
his
mind,
the
construction
of
a
city
like
this
must
truly
be
man’s
greatest
achievement.
Shiva’s
entourage
rode
up
to
the
drawbridge
across
the
field
of
spikes
to
the
Tamra
platform.
The
drawbridge
had
been
reinforced
with
metal
bars
at
the
bottom
and
had
roughened
baked
bricks
laid
out
on
top
so
that
horses
and
chariots
would
not
slip.
There
was
something
about
the
bricks
he
had
seen
across
the
empire
that
had
intrigued
Shiva.
Turning
to
Nandi
he
asked,
Are
these
bricks
made
as
per
some
standard
process?’.
‘Yes
my
Lord,’
replied
a
surprised
Nandi.
All
the
bricks
in
Meluha
are
made
as
per
specifications
and
guidelines
given
by
the
Chief
Architect
of
the
empire.
But
how
did
you
guess?’
